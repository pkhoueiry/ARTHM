**The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE)**

ENCODE is a public research consortium aimed at identifying all functional elements in the human and mouse genomes.

**Tutorial Objectives:**
    In this tutorial, we will explore the ENCODE project database to search and 
    visualize genomics data generated by different labs, as part of the ENCODE project.
    In our tutorial, we will learn how to search, find and download data for a specific assay (i.e RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data on K562 cells).
    For RNA-seq, we will visualize expression profiles from 5 different hematopoietic cell lines (K562, GM12878, HL-60, Karpas-422, OCI-LY7).
    We will also add information from Pol II ChIP-seq performed on K562 and GM12878.


## Interrogating and visualizing ENCODE data

Visit https://www.encodeproject.org/

As you notice, several NGS based assays were used to interrogate several features in the genome. This includes expression assays, chromatin accessibility assays, Genome architecture assays and so on.
The home page gives us a general overview on available assays. 

```Select Human as model organism```

You notice that **12906** Biosample exist. Since we will be focusing on cell-lines related data, we will select cell line

```Select Cell line from the Biosample Type list```

This will open a new page with a matrix summarizing, for each cell line, the different NGS related assays performed.

For instance, there are 635 different ChIP-seq experiment performed on K562 as part of the ENCODE project.

``` Click on 635 an you will get more information on each of the 635 ChIP-seq including the Transcription factor name```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/pkhoueiry/ARTHM/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
