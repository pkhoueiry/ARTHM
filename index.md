**ARTHM Workshop: Bioinformatics And Data Mining In Cancer Research Workshop** 

**The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE)**

ENCODE is a public research consortium aimed at identifying all functional elements in the human and mouse genomes.



### Interrogating and visualizing ENCODE data

**Objectives:**
    In this tutorial, we will explore the ENCODE project database to search and 
    visualize genomics data generated by different labs, as part of the ENCODE project.
    In our tutorial, we will learn how to search, find and download data for a specific assay (i.e PolII ChIP-seq on K562 cells).
    For this, we will focus on one precise transcription factor called CTCF. 
    CTCF is a major transcriptional repressor in mammalian cells. 
    It is implicated in several cellular mechanisms including transcription regulation, 
    insulation and has been showing lately to regulate chromatin architecture by
    stabilizing loop formation and 3D structures.
